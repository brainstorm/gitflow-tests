This is an attempt to let people know how to use git
in a professional way without feeling the pain of
barebones git:

Better version control
    * Does not even need admin interaction
        * Create repositories as you see fit/need

Backups
    * Lost data on your computer ? Your code is somewhere else
    * With history... reproducible research anyone ?

Collaborating with your colleagues 
    * "We don't talk with each other so often" ?
        * Why don't we see each other commits and then talk about them ?
            * How to improve feature X and/or merge with code Y
        * Talk with the world out there, lots of code waiting to be reused !

Setting up a python course
    * And explaining why gitflow is interesting
